# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the daily programming puzzles released as part of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of coding challenges that take place every December. It's designed to be fun and engaging, offering challenges that range from beginner-friendly to highly advanced. Each day, a new puzzle is unlocked, providing an opportunity to improve your problem-solving and coding skills.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by day, with each folder representing a single day of the challenge. Each folder typically contains:

- **`input.txt`**: The puzzle input provided for the day.
- **`solution.py`**: My Python implementation of the solution.
- **`README.md`**: A brief explanation of the problem and the approach taken to solve it (optional).

Example structure:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ day01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ day02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
...
```
